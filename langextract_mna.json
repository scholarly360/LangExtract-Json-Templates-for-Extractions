  "prompt": "Task: Extract every merger or acquisition (including stake purchases and mergers) mentioned in the text.\n\nFor each deal, create ONE extraction with class \"ma_deal\".\nUse the SHORTEST exact text span that clearly refers to the deal (usually the sentence or key clause like \"X to acquire Y for $Z\").\n\nAttributes (use exact spans from the text; do not paraphrase):\n- acquirer: the buyer/first-named party (for mergers, use the first-named company).\n- target: the company being acquired / merged with.\n- amount_text: the deal value as written (e.g., \"$2.1 billion\", \"₹3,700 crore\", \"Rs 750 crore\"). If no value is stated, set to \"not disclosed\".\n\nRules:\n- Accept verbs/synonyms: acquire, buy, purchase, take over, merge with, combine with, acquire a % stake in, all-stock deal, cash-and-stock deal.\n- Prefer total deal value over per-share prices; if only a per-share price is present and clearly tied to the acquisition, use that per-share amount as amount_text (include the \"per share\" words).\n- Keep currency and units AS WRITTEN (support $, USD, ₹, Rs, INR, lakh, crore, million, billion). Do not normalize or convert.\n- If multiple deals appear, produce one \"ma_deal\" extraction per deal.\n- Do not invent amounts or company names not present in the text.",
